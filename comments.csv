Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"Most difficult class I have ever had to take. For each topic, you will be given one (1) unclear example before moving on to the next. Lectures are mandatory but confusing and not worth your time. Had to supplement lectures by finding hours worth of online videos to learn anything. Lectures 40-50% average on exams, everyone was beyond stressed."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"Pankaj was phenomenal! Accessible to help outside class and on Ed, and made dukes toughest undergrad CS class manageable. The one downside is that his accent can be a bit hard to understand. The class was redesigned to include programming components, which were a fun challenge. Definitely not an easy class regardless of prof, but Pankaj is great."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"I like Pankaj's to-the-point lecturing style. He knows clearly what he is talking about. I went to many of his office hours and he often gave abstract remarks, but somehow was those just enough to help me through a question. CS 330 is always hard, but I thought the real midterms were consistently easier than old midterms (with other profs)."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,He is really nice. Go find him in his office hour. He will give you direction in your homework.
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"Definitely the hardest class I've taken. Prof Agarwal is organized and clearly knows the material very well, but lectures are still complicated due to difficulty of the material. Lots of supplemental readings. Nearly all homework and exam questions are difficult. Be prepared to work very hard, especially if you don't have a strong math background."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"Dude is absolutely brilliant. Doesn't bother using notes for his lectures because he understands the material so well.  Tests are ridiculously hard, but this class is always hard. Hires amazing TAs. You will learn from a master if you take his class. "
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,Agarwal is brilliant. He has such a good understanding of Algorithms that he doesn't use notes for any of his lectures. Gives lots of supplementary readings to help us understand. Very organized lectures. Makes the TAs attend the lectures to ensure recitations are on point. BUT the class content and tests are very difficult. Class is curved.
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"possibly the most difficult class I have ever taken as CS major. irritatingly unhelpful professor (if you are stuck on a problem, he will give you a hint but usually the hint isn't enough to get you past being stuck). doesn't provide answers to textbook problems, so doing problems is often frustrating and time-consuming."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,"Class is hard, regardless of the professor teaching it. Do as many problems as possible. Pankaj is nice and helpful but this material is just difficult."
Pankaj K. Agarwal,3.9,No Comments
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"I took 102, 201, and 342 with ola. 342 was easy, you get out what you put in. Relevant and current. Amazing speakers "
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Guest talks every Thursday from alums ranging across a wide spectrum of experiences. Flexible with deadlines. You get out what you put in, but the content is across the board amazingly relevant, topical, interesting, and accessible. Except for the final paper, everything is graded on submitting on time with peer reviews."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,Lectures were really interesting. I enjoyed having guest speakers every week. If you do the work you'll get a good grade and the assignments tend to be interesting and enjoyable to do. 
Owen Astrachan,4.2,Simply the GOAT. Enough said.
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Not clear in his explanations, and class time was a complete waste. Didn't seem like he knew what he was doing and relied way too much on his slides. Probably a great 201 professor, but it doesn't seem like he can teach anything else."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,By far one of the best (and probably easiest) classes I took. I could have gone by without going to lectures but I didn't want to miss a single one of them. Definitely take a class with him if you can!
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"For a pass-fail class, Astrachan clearly knows how to make students want to attend every lecture! He organizes speakers a lot and has them talk about their experience in the field and lets students ask questions, and as for course content he's very knowledgeable and his years of experience are very apparent. Take any class you can with Astrachan!"
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"243 is a S/U course where you basically do leetcode problems. Super helpful for SWE internship interviews, and Professor Astrachan brought in guest speakers who work at FAANG-type companies that shared their experiences. I would recommend doing more than the problems he assigns in class if you really want to get good at interview problems. "
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Very good professor. He was the best professor I've taken so far at Duke, and he gives great lectures. CS201 was not very difficult, especially if you had any java experience. If you are an engineer debating EGR103L or CS201, definitely take this course! I will absolutely take more courses with Owen if possible."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,Best professor I've taken during my four years of Duke.
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"All lectures recorded and he gives many retake options. If you fully understand every lecture and do the exams and apts, definitely will take away something useful from this class. But definitely there is a way to get an A without learning anything. Need to attend discussion sessions."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Compsci 201 was one of the best classes I had last semester. The class was not stressful at all. The TAs are also extremely helpful and the lectures are engaging. (If you've never used Java before, the first 2 weeks might be a little confusing but you'll get the hang of it. You will not need the Zybook)"
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Don't bother buying zybook. His lectures were good, but often felt long and tiring. The small midterms and the final were easy and low stress. The projects were pretty difficult and confusing, but TAs had a lot of office hours. The APTs and APT quizzes weren't too bad. Ola was extremely flexible, but don't procrastinate the projects or the APTs."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Professor Astrachan is amazing. His lectures can be funny and he ties in real-world scenarios. His structure of doing multiple exams as opposed to a couple of midterms greatly reduces the pressure in the class. Don't bother to waste money on the textbook for 201, he explains everything in lecture."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Ola is great. Expectations throughout the course are very clear and there are a million ways to get an A. If you're interested in compsci, this class will teach you all of its foundations."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,This class is an easy A but I learned nothing. Ola is a nice guy but he's just not a very organized or understandable lecturer. You won't get to know grade boundaries at the end too so good luck estimating your grade. I actually think it's theoretically possible to not know how to code at all and still pass this class. Discussions were fun tho.
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"If you have any prior Java experience whatsoever, COMPSCI201 will be incredibly easy for you. Projects/exams are very straightforward, every assignment is open-notes/open-Internet, and there's loads of extra credit (can take every exam twice, lots of make-up problem sets, etc). Ola is a great lecturer - you will get so much out of this class."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Ola is a very outgoing professor and gives many opportunities to boost your grade. Knowing basic Java syntax at the start of the semester is important so you don't fall behind. However, the class does not prepare you enough to answer medium-level SWE questions."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Class is very easy, but my problem is that you do not learn much. Projects are busy work and do not teach anything. Lectures are extremely vague and do not cover content in-depth, leaving students unprepared for intermediate-level interview questions. Does not tell students grade cutoffs, even at the end. Ask to take the skip test if you can."
Owen Astrachan,4.2,"Fantastic! Ola really knows his stuff and is a giant in the field of computer science. Great lectures! Everyone should take 201 with Ola if possible. Grading system is well laid out from the beginning of the semester, and if you complete every assignment, it is difficult to not get an A. Helps to have some knowledge of Java before but not a must."
Alberto Bartesaghi,4,"Computational Imaging was a really interesting course that touched on a variety of imaging topics. We had 6 coding homeworks and 3 quizzes. The lowest for each was dropped. If you have python/numpy experience, the homework shouldn't be difficult (and we worked in pairs). Prof. Bartesaghi was good at making the class applicable to the real world."
Alberto Bartesaghi,4,"CS 290 Comp. Imaging was fun & useful, and he's a great lecturer who takes questions and re-explains tough stuff when asked (he responds well to feedback!). Hw/quiz difficulty depends on your experience with Python and math. If you're confident in either one, you'll learn a lot and it won't be too challenging. If you know neither, it will be tough!"
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Not the best at explaining concepts but is extremely nice. He is super helpful in office hours, which is great considering how difficult his homeworks and exams are."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"super wholesome, caring math professor. pioneer/expert in his field. read the textbook and watch the lectures before class. very smart guy and expects you to understand at first glance and doesn't explain more unless you ask (in which case he explains very well)"
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"501 is incredibly difficult, but Professor Calderbank is very helpful during office hours. The material of the class goes well beyond what I anticipated, though almost all of the material is exciting to learn about."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"This will be the most difficult class you take at Duke. You do coding theory (including quantum error correction), lattices, and algebraic number theory among other things alongside groups, rings, and fields. The course moves rapidly at a high level of abstraction and you are expected to understand the material entirely upon first seeing it."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Difficult, b prepared 2 grind every 2 weeks when problem sets are due (find a group). Only a midterm and final, both takehome. Calderbank is rly nice and his office hours are v helpful. If ur struggling, read textbook + watch past lecture recordings b4 class. Class taught with a lot of CS applications based on his research, cool if ur cs/math"
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Best mathematics professor at Duke, or anywhere really..."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Like others said, he cares a TON for every student in his class. However, his lectures often feel unmotivated; he doesn't give context for definitions, nor does he give clear visuals. He assumes you already know the material prior to his lecture, which makes him hard to follow (unless you read the book!). But, workload (mostly in groups) is average"
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Just the sweetest person I've ever met. A really good teacher who cares about his students. Some lectures go really fast, be prepared to work hard and focus 100% in class. He's extremely friendly and very approachable."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Calderbank is one of the best mathematicians at Duke. With an illustrious track record of producing solid contributions to various research fields (coding theory, quantum computing, etc.) and leading various policy initiatives (at AT&T Bell Labs and the Rhodes Information Initiative, etc.), he has a mind and style for all students to learn from."
Robert Calderbank,4.6,"Wonderful and inspiring professor. Brilliant. Huge reputation. Class based on his notes composed of 20 or so lectures. Not your typical abstract algebra course--there is an emphasis on algebraic applications to coding theory, binary fields, and sphere-packing. Expect to prepare homework problems for every class. 50% HW, 50% take-home final"
Jeffery Chase,4.1,He can go off on tangents during lectures sometimes and get into material that is out of scope of the class and even though the content can be very dense at times he does a pretty good job at breaking it down. He is super nice and approachable and also really cares about his students learning. I would take a class with Prof Chase if you can. 
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"This was his first time teaching 210, so there were some hurdles, but besides his tests, I thought Chase was a really great professor. He really tried to make the material interesting and relatable, and he equips you with tons of resources to guarantee success. His midterms weren't the most fair, but he didn't give us a final, so I forgive him :)."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"This class is pretty tough, but Chase is a nice guy and excellent professor who rubs some of his excitement about operating systems and software off on you. The material is dry by nature, but I thought most of the projects were fun. He is terrible at designing tests for some reason, so if he just had someone else do that he would be easy 5 stars."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Professor Chase is kind and easygoing, and was effective at conveying some of the core ideas of distributed systems without getting tied up in the details. Lectures can sometimes get a little bit rambly, but he grades pretty easily."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"One of the better Duke CS lecturers. He's pretty good at explaining things, although he can get kind of salty (and funny) on Piazza."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"A lot of work. Takes a long time to do the labs. But the labs are not hard for the most part. That is, if you just put the time in, you will eventually get the points..."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Graded on weekly lab projects that take up a ton of time. I spent 10-20 hours every week doing them. Dr. Chase is nice enough but he wasn't very responsive on Piazza until end of the semester. Luckily there were a lot of helpful ""unofficial TAs"" helping out fellow students."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"There are labs every week so its very lab heavy and most of the labs with the exception of 3 are difficult and time consuming. It isn't necessary to watch lecture, its only applicable to the lecture quizzes. There are labs that are considered ""optional"" but they are not. His late penalty is very generous as long as you put in the work."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,Professor Chase is a pretty good lecturer and is fairly accessible outside of class. He elaborately explains confusing concepts.
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"I liked Professor Chase's lecture style very much, he laid out complex material in a very straightforward and understandable way. While the workload was heavy (the projects take a long time), it was worth it because I learned a lot and enjoyed the material."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Prof. Chase really made Operating Systems a fun class to take. Admittedly, I may be a bit biased as I found the subject matter incredibly interesting but even my friends who aren't huge fans of the subject found the lectures engaging. The workload is pretty manageable for the most part; the only time I ever felt kinda swamped was the threads lab."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"I really liked 310 with Chase. His lectures were clear and interesting in spite of the sometimes dry or complex material. He's accessible and active on Piazza, and tries his best to help with the labs. The labs are really interesting, if tough at times, but are great and realistic applications of the material and good interview talking points!"
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Chase is someone that takes some time to get used to. I went to lecture, but often found the lecture recordings more useful as I could pause when he went too quickly.  The projects in this class take a good amount of time, but are doable if you start early and ask for help. Exams are difficult, but Chase was VERY fair in his grading."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Chase is a great professor. He tries to make the dry material more engaging and interesting, and takes student feedback into consideration for grading. It's unfortunate that CS310 at Duke is a poorly structured class. Lectures are hard to follow, and because there is no formally assigned textbook the class is skewed towards auditory learners."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"I enjoyed his class. Jumps around a lot in lectures. Tries to make dry material interesting with stories, and while his tests are hard, he gives lots of partial credit. Great personality and very helpful in office hours. It's not his fault that the autograder takes a long time, you'll get that no matter which professor you take the class with."
Jeffery Chase,4.1,Took two classes with him and really enjoyed both. His lecturers are eye-opening and introduce research aspects in industry-related topics. Great learning experience.
Jeffery Chase,4.1,Jeffery is a great lecturer and an interesting guy to take a class from. He likes to illustrate the narrative of the researchers as they uncovered some break-through technology in distributed systems. He has a quirky personality and is more than happy to talk things over with you.
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Although some students followed along well, I felt that the instruction was not explicit. Instead of teaching concepts block by block for students, it was almost like Chase was simply talking about or having a conversation about concepts for the lecture period, letting his lecture wander with his thoughts. If that works for you, go for this class"
Jeffery Chase,4.1,Learned a lot
Jeffery Chase,4.1,"Chase is a really sweet, nerdy, humorous guy. I respect him a lot as a person. However, I really feel that 310 was hard to follow. He loves to jump around in his slides, and after 5 minutes, you'll think ""What is he trying to say..."" The way he lectures is scattered tho u can watch lectures online. But, most ppl really question how much they learn"
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Not difficult per se to get an A/B, but homeworks and projects take a lot of time. 3 exams are 65% of your grade - not super hard but rely on your ability to reason. Not enough practice given for exams; homeworks, lectures, projects, and exams are often unrelated. TAs are helpful but don't always know the answers. Bruce rambles and loves to talk."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Don't understand the negative reviews. This class was challenging but fair. Extra credit on projects, regrade requests, and office hours made this course manageable. Some lectures were unnecessarily complicated, but the review sessions, ed posts, recitation, prepared me for the content of exams. I would have liked lecture to line up more w exams."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Attending OH (and finding a good partner) is a must for Problem Sets (even though some TAs don't know the answer). Bruce is a giant in his field, but lectures often go over your head and differ from exams. Lots of learning done through recitation/hw. Class is curved so that everyone who participates/does hw gets an A or B, and the mean is a B+/A-"
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Material is interesting and TAs were wonderful, but Donald's in-person lectures are unintelligible - the only way I learned anything was his recorded Zoom lectures on YouTube - and I left feeling unprepared in terms of proof-writing and algorithm analysis for 330. Insane midterms, easy final, huge end-of-semester curve. Get a good PSET partner."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,OH are a must if you want to do well on the short assignments and problem sets. There were a handful of great (and not so great) TAs. Bruce was very unhelpful and often taught material irrelevant to the exams.
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Material is not the worst but is taught in the most inaccessible fashion with lectures above the needed level. TAs do not understand the content, office hours do not help, and Professor Donald is rather condescending. He is so afraid of cheating that any questions to him are never answered and invoke a sarcastic rudeness. "
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Very knowledgeable and lectures on great topics, though they can be hard to understand. This does not pair well with his superior attitude, often mocking students in his replies. Manageable assignments if you start early enough, though it will be difficult to get help if you are stuck. Decent course with an unempathetic and narcissistic professor."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Awful class and awful professor. So many homework assignments. If you're stuck on an assignment, you're in trouble, since the Office Hours are packed and you have a limited time to receive help. "
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"I hated the flipped classroom. The lectures were just Zoom recordings from last year, and quality was terrible. The in-person lecture was a Q&A session, but it was useless. Students asked either basic understanding questions that others already understood, or very abstract and irrelevant things. Large number of assignments; the grind never stops. "
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Incredibly lazy and arrogant professor who uses past recorded lectures instead of lecturing in person. Believes flipped classroom is superior, going to class in person is worthless. Hid final exam grades and deleted course website after final grades were released. Tough grading with no partial credit. Take the substitution courses instead of CS230."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"This class was a nightmare. The flipped classroom approach was terrible, with him requiring us to watch recorded lectures on content that never came up on assignments or exams, and no one coming to class in person which made in-person lectures terrible and unhelpful. Go to office hours, some of the TAs (Matt <3) are great and actually care."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"By far the worst class Ive ever taken and hopefully will ever take. I wont bother to reiterate what everyone else is saying, but I wanted to provide my opinion as someone who did very well in the class. Do not take cs 230 with Bruce Donald. This professor and class are an embarrassment to Dukes CS department."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Had very unclear expectationsgrades were set up such that you had no idea what youd get until the end. The flipped classroom technique and haphazard website made it extremely difficult and frustrating to actually learn the material. Tests and homework were designed to exceed the expected level of comprehension, which felt very disheartening."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"2 things to add. #1 ""Short assignments"" are not short at all and often test concepts above what is needed or even learned in class (some TAs don't even know how to do them). #2 He is so out of touch. Acts so smug thinking his silly math/statistics brain teasers could be asked in our interviews. And is so proud of knowing the answers when we don't??"
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Doesn't teach anymore and delegated grading to an awful head UTA. Extremely harsh grading, complete lack of transparency, and overall just an enjoyable class. Take this class in the spring if possible, or get the Substitution. Maybe with a better head UTA this class will improve, but don't count on it. Very shady, non-responsive, and unhelpful."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"350 characters isnt enough to describe how awful this class is. Useless material. Lazy flipped lecture format. ZERO clarity in grading (literally refused to answer questions about it). Hes absurdly arrogant. Wants students to fail. Obscene amounts of work. Zero practice for tests, which he designs with a mean of 50. If u wanna hate CS, take this."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,Not a single concept is useful. Horrible teacher. Consistently assesses you on content BEFORE it is formally taught. Practically 0 partial credit given if even one minor detail is off. Head TA is even more demonic than professor and enjoys watching students suffer. Attempted to conceal students' grades on final exam and forbade regrade requests.
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"This class is absolutely terrible. Grading for exams is harsh, give no partial points if part of your answer is correct. Some TAs are really unhelpful and mean. You learn nothing useful, feels like a complete waste of time. Exam prep tips are always unclear. The teaching team is just uncaring in general and only wants everyone to have poor scores."
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Echoing others' frustrations, the absolute worst aspect of this class was the flipped classroom. Most lazy thing ever, in-person lectures were useless. That leads into problem 2: lectures and recitations quickly devolve into getting too specific into theory and neglecting to teach what you actually need to know for tests. Tests are the hardest ever"
Bruce Randall Donald,2.4,"Why in the world would you choose to reuse your ultra boring, hour-long recorded quarantine lectures instead of actually teaching us in class?? This added an additional 2+ hours of mind numbing lecture outside of class time every week on top of the already frenetic pace of assignments. This class was a true nightmare."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"No feedback, unclear grading criteria. Communication skills very subpar. Good programmer but very bad instructor"
Robert Duvall,2.4,Duvall is tough but really knows his stuff. You'll learn a lot from the class if you have the right attitude. Not sure why people are complaining that he is condescending/doesn't respect his students. He does seem to have a low tolerance for incompetence but if you put in the effort you won't feel disrespected
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Can't say more how much I've learned in this course. I look back at my code I wrote before taking this course and looks so bad. I had a pretty solid Java background, but still learned a lot. You can also learn from great team mates, and professor is passionate about what he teaches. But don't take if you're not as passionate about software dev."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"I don't think this class could make significant improvement to a student's coding ability IF you are not somewhat already good at Java and familiar with polymorphism or OOP and such. That said, if you are already a good coder who has done super well in 201, you probably still need a bit of other knowledge to do well in this class. "
Robert Duvall,2.4,I thought he was rather disorganized and didn't tell us about assignments that were on class websites.
Robert Duvall,2.4,Grades were arbitrary and only given for a very few number of assignments. You are better served learning this material from an internship or work than in this class.
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Class is VERY project-based (one a week), and there is a learning curve for new programmers. But, Professor Duvall answered specific questions on class forum in very timely fashion, always had extra office hours available, and would stay an hour after class to help each student that needed it. I had no prior experience. Now, CS 201 bound."
Robert Duvall,2.4,I had to sign up for CAPs after this class. No feedback/grading until you receive a surprise final grade. Senior Lecturer Duvall is condescending and single-handedly snuffs out the hopes of the ECE/CS. Impossible workload. This is a course where you can give it your full 20 hr+ a week best effort and end with a surprise B. Do not take.
Robert Duvall,2.4,"The class promises a lot, most of which are useful skills to have in preparation for entering the industry. Unfortunately, the course is ironically designed poorly for learning. The lectures are pointless , and there is no feedback until the end making it impossible to gauge how you are doing with improving as a developer. "
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Started well, but it became clear he struggles to connect with students. Though he tried to be accessible to us, his lectures were long and pointless, the work was tedious or difficult, and prior computer science experience became almost essential. I did not enjoy attending this class and will likely not take another CS course because of it."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"308 is by far the most useful CS class I've ever taken. Professor Duvall knows a lot about project design and in-class examples + labs make the topics clear. The projects and readings are a lot of work, but he does not expect you to implement every feature in the guidelines. I would recommend taking this course with three other easy courses. "
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Duvall and his class(es) are super tough, and the comments are correct in the expectation of spending 30+ hours per week outside of class on his work. He may come off as condescending in lectures but if you meet with him one on one or ask for help at any point, he is so there for you. He really cares about his students, and you can learn so much!!"
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Beyond what others have said: The lectures lack structure and his exceptions can often be unclear. You won't have a clue what your grade is until after the end of semester. I know multiple people who dropped either ECE or CS in order to avoid this class along with CS 330. With that said, the class does give you things to talk about in interviews."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Okay, if you want to know about software, take this course. But keep in mind that this course will take at least 30+hrs of commitment every week, just as an internship would. With that said, students are often overwhelmed by the amount of work and claim that they haven't ""learned"" anything. However, if you put in the time, you will learn A LOT!"
Robert Duvall,2.4,CS290 started strong with an incredible compilation of resources and examples for web dev. Duvall unfortunately is as poor an instructor as others note. Zero grading and zero grading criteria before the end of the semester. Ive never had a professor so disrespectful of his students  he is violent with our time and assumes the worst intentions.
Robert Duvall,2.4,"He is certainly knowledgeable about coding, but is poor at running a class. We received no grades besides one midterm grade on DukeHub and then our final grade. There is no grading structure. Also, a lot of writing assignments with no feedback. Only learned due to personal research. A lot of effort and time, the projects are insane."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"290 was better than 307 because it didn't have all the unnecessary documentation and busywork, but projects were still very time-consuming. Condescending, but it's never personal and you should just take it with a grain of salt. A LOT of work, but you will learn more coding skills in a Duvall class than almost all other CS classes at Duke."
Robert Duvall,2.4,"This class was a lot of work. I don't think students are expected to actually complete the projects. Although Duvall may not have industry experience, he knows a lot about programming/Java and taught me a ton about good coding practices. Absolutely the most useful class I have taken so far at Duke, would recommend for people interested in software"
Robert Duvall,2.4,"Prof. Duvall is incredibly condescending in his demeanor, and his lectures are completely ineffective. Several amounted to nothing more than a ""chewing out"" of teams that had failed to pay tithe to the self-appointed ""God of Agile"" whom, afaik, has never worked a day in the industry in his life. Project feedback is infrequent and of poor quality."
Robert Duvall,2.4,Please dont take this class! The entire setup of the course makes it impossible to learn what he is trying to teach. Why setup a class on software design to have projects each with an impossible amount of features to implement? The amount of work required is absurd and made an isolated college experience in the midst of a pandemic even worse.������
Brandon Fain,4.8,Brandon Fain was very helpful and understanding!
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Everything on the exams he covers in lectures, so the exams are fair, you just have to put in the work to understand the content. Go into the lectures having read some of the textbook on the topic of that day so that you are not struggling to understand what he's talking about in class. Start projects early. Great professor and super nice overall. "
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Offers no help to students through TAs so assignments are confusing (TAs are not given rubrics or keys so even TAs are confused). Yelled at us after a test one time (?). Incredibly condescending with a fast-paced curriculum that nobody could keep up with (40% average on final exam). Honestly the worst class I have ever taken, wouldn't take again."
Brandon Fain,4.8,The lectures are very well explained and concise. Although sometimes he breezes through some topics he's generally a very great lecturer and teacher.
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Fain was fairly helpful in teaching Data Structures and Algorithms. The lectures were somewhat boring, and there's always consistent assignments. A lot of how the course will go for you depends on your previous experience with coding. He's also like 5'3 lol"
Brandon Fain,4.8,"This class is tedious and difficult. The lectures focus on confusing abstract topics, but the tests are mainly about coding. The class does not teach how to code, but focuses on how to find the runtime complexity and memory of methods or code chunks. Exams are hard, you will need help on projects."
Brandon Fain,4.8,Professor Fain is a very accommodating professor and an amazing lecturer. He tries to explain every concept very clearly and takes time to clear up doubts. He is very generous with extensions and partial credits. He makes sure that you don't have to read the textbook after listening to the lecture and/or going through his slides.
Brandon Fain,4.8,"CS201 is interesting enough, but Fain is a monotone and boring lecturer. "
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Great introduction to Java and data structures and algorithms! It is a tough class, no doubt, especially if you don't have Java background, and there is a learning curve, but you learn many skills. His grading policy affords MANY opportunties to get maintain good grades (participation, discussion, projects, APTs) and your final is optional."
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Professor Fain is an engaging and entertaining lecturer who teaches the class in a clear and fun manner. The concepts are all interesting, well as interesting as data structures and algorithms can be. APTs allow for low stress practice, and the exams are all fairly straightforward given you study properly."
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Professor Fain is such a nice guy. He is very smart but he makes you feel comfortable when you ask him questions, and his office hours are very helpful. His lectures are very clear and he really tries to make them engaging. Grading criterial is super clear and will drop your lowest grades on everything. "
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Loved the class. The lectures were super clear and interesting. Projects were pretty hard but fun, and not very time-consuming. If you actually show up to class and do the work, you'll have an amazing experience with Fain."
Brandon Fain,4.8,"He's obviously really passionate and cares about CS, but he can be out of touch with students. One of the smartest guys ever though."
Brandon Fain,4.8,Prior coding experience especially in Java makes a huge difference. Very different/harder than CS 101. Good lecturer and fair. Nice dude.
Brandon Fain,4.8,"This is my second class with Prof Fain and I'm currently taking it. I feel his lectures sound like they have been practiced several times. He speaks undisrupted without pause or even a simple ""like"" or ""um"". Also speaks in a very elevated way when it comes to word choice. Kinda hard to focus and listen to imo. Class seems fair, however. "
Brandon Fain,4.8,Just have to put in the work. He definitely creates a fair rubric but a couple screw ups can tank your grade
Brandon Fain,4.8,The class is well-structured and has a lot of opportunities to score well. Exam retakes are built into the grading system. Lectures are recorded which is a big advantage but discussion sections aren't productive.
Brandon Fain,4.8,"If you've never coded in Java before, I would recomend spending some time before the class starts getting familiar with the basics using literally any online mini course type thing. Fain is very supportive, the grading is generous, and there's a lot of resources if you're struggling."
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Don't buy the online zybook, its a waste of money. I never used it once. Be sure to give yourself at least 2-3 days on all projects, even if you are good at CS, as it's possible to get stuck. Otherwise, great teaching makes the class relatively easy."
Brandon Fain,4.8,"Prof Fain truly cares about his students and provides many opportunities to boost your grade through projects, APTs, etc. The testing format is 3 midterms, each with a corresponding section on the exam that serves as a make-up or re-do if you do not like your grade on the previous exam. The exams are SUPER similar to the practice exams. Love Fain!"
Rong Ge,5,"The first third of the class is the most challenging, and it can be tough to get up to speed if you haven't written proofs before. However, the assignments are clear and office hours are helpful for completing them. Professor Ge is extremely clear in his explanations, and the course was arranged in a way that made the different topics very explicit"
Rong Ge,5,"The homeworks can be pretty time-intensive, but once you figure out the expectations for proofs the whole class becomes a lot easier. Rong gives much more manageable and reasonable exam questions compared to the other profs for this class, so would recommend taking it with him if you can!"
Rong Ge,5,"It's like he's injecting knowledge directly into your brain when he's teaching. Rong G., the G stands for GOAT."
Rong Ge,5,RonGOAT 
Rong Ge,5,"A very good professor, and probably the best at Duke CS to take the class with. He is a good lecturer, and if you take the time to watch and understand the lectures, the class becomes a lot simpler. Extremely straightforward with his exams, and arguably lenient with grading criteria on exams. Frontloaded workload for HW; easier after midterm 1."
Rong Ge,5,He is so amazing! Content and homework is not easy but he is sooooooo helpful after class and during OH. Would literally guide me through homework questions step by step during OH or stay back after class because of my questions. Everyone is happy about the final grade he gave as he was being lenient.
Rong Ge,5,Very hard course. A lot of proofs to formulate and lots of time-consuming HW/tests.
Rong Ge,5,"This class was horrible online. The recorded lectures didn't help me at all and I ended up looking at Stanford's equivalent class for help. TA's were very helpful for the HW, try to do the HW with friends if possible. Tests were extremely difficult and so was the final with a 60 average. Tried to curve the whole class down by a whole letter grade."
Rong Ge,5,Professor Ge (co-teaching with Professor Panigrahi) was an excellent lecturer and explained all the covered concepts well. This class also had many opportunities to clear up confusions through TA office hours and synchronous lectures. Professor Ge was also very understanding with long exam slots.
Rong Ge,5,He gives really good lectures that are recorded. Problem sets take time but TAs can be helpful. Exams are hard but the class is curved. I think he's the clearest lecturer out of the profs who teach 330.
Rong Ge,5,"Perhaps Ge did not transition well to online learning but 330 with him was a pain. None of his recorded videos were understandable, one had to rewatch multiple times, exams and tests were hard and graded toughly. Doesn't really care nor interact with the students, no opportunity for 1-1, always refers you to the TAs who were extremely disorganized."
Rong Ge,5,"Amazing professor, does a great job explaining complicated concepts. Weekly problem sets that are pretty difficult. Midterms are fair, but are not easy by any means."
Rong Ge,5,"Amazing professor who gives clear lectures. All lectures are recorded online. Some of the homework assignments are very difficult, so get started early. Tests are not easy, but are very fair. One of the best professors I've had, though."
Rong Ge,5,"330 is a hard class, but Rong is the prof to take it with. He's a solid lecturer who's always willing to answer questions, and lectures are recorded so you can digest the material at your own pace. Weekly HW takes time, but grading is fair and office hours (Rong + TAs) really helped. Exams aren't easy, though you can do well with consistent effort."
Rong Ge,5,"The class is very difficult, but the material is easy to digest. It also has one of the fairest and clearest grading criteria of any cs class I've taken. The only work in this class consists of completing the homework and preparing for the exams, which both drop your lowest grade."
Rong Ge,5,"Professor Ge is a solid professor, knows his stuff, really cares about his students, and knows it's a challenging class. Homework is hard, but it's not entirely his fault. Two major gripes: (1) his teaching style did not click at all for me, so recitation was where I really learned, and (2) he hand-waves over important details in lecture."
Rong Ge,5,"one of the best CS professors I have ever had. 330 content is very difficult to understand; however, Rong breaks things down and makes them as simple as possible. his lectures are clear and easy to follow. he records lectures so you can go back and review easily. grading policies are fair. highly recommend him for 330!"
Rong Ge,5,Best CS professor in the department if you dont consider ola
Rong Ge,5,"Incredible professor. Extremely clear lectures and super helpful. If he is teaching ANY course, do not hesitate to enroll."
Rong Ge,5,"He was a pretty good professor and gave you the tools to succeed - you just had to put the time in and probably go to office hours for help with the homework. By nature 330 is a difficult class, but it wasn't too bad with Rong. With all that being said, he is an excruciatingly boring lecturer and class attendance was probably at around 25%."
Raluca Mihaela Gordan,4,"Dr. Gordan was a fantastic professor. CS260 was a tough class, but actually going through the exercises and assignments provides the bulk of learning. There are no exams or quizzes, but lectures are integral to keeping up with the course. Dr. Gordan was great at clarifying murky concepts, and maintained strong out-of-class accessibility."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"The grade is mainly from 7 problem sets (no exams). The first 2 are insanely difficult, and after that it becomes quite manageable. This is a compliment, but if I Hartemink wasn't such a great prof, I definitely would've dropped during the first month. He's caring, super clear, INSANELY smart, and just a great guy. Hard class, but very rewarding!"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Absolutely brilliant professor who knows how to teach and break down concepts into digestible chunks. Problem sets can be long, but you're given 2 weeks to complete each one. As long as you make good use of office hours and attend lectures, you'll be fine. Probably the best professor I've had at Duke. "
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"He is a great professor and a great person. He is brilliant and has a way of relating everything (even real life stuff) back to bioinformatics/ML. I genuinely enjoyed his class. Beware that he uses a weird ""negative"" grading scheme, where you start with a 100 and keep getting points taken off for every mistake. Make sure to cover your bases on HW."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Not impressed with this professor or the class. The class consists of ten HW assignments that are so harshly graded and subsequently curved that you really don't know your final grade until it's released. I think I would have liked this class more if it wasn't so theoretical, especially since BIO 201 is the only prereq listed for this class."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"This guy is a genius. He triplemajored at Duke and then went to Oxford and MIT. Now he teaches us really interesting algorithms and bio concepts and I have learned so much in this class. I do not like bio at all but from a CS perspective, it is fascinating. 10 problem sets are the whole grade, and TA help is a must. It's a lot of work, but worth it"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Professor Hartemink is incredible. Not only is he impressively smart (the guy has like five degrees), but he is a talented teacher as well. Note: While some say his CS260 class is hard, what they really mean is that it is a lot of work. It's actually quite easy to a good grade in (no tests, no midterms, no final, just 7 coding problem sets)."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"A really incredible professor. His lectures are engaging and he is very passionate about what he teaches. He is amazing at explaining things and I always looked forward to class. Super nice guy and very, very smart. Pretty tough class but I felt like I got a lot out of it, I actually like his philosophy on challenging you and making you think."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Absolutely top quality lecturer. I've gone to a lot of CS lectures in my time, and his is by far the best. Unfortunately, the grading on the assignments can be vague and frustrating."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Hartemink is probably my favorite professor I have ever had. His class is tough, but it's super rewarding if you put in the work and start your assignments early. He is a fantastic lecturer and always explains things so plainly. He also really cares about his students, too, though maybe not necessarily their grades. This is the best class!"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Hartemink is a really smart professor who does a good job of keeping you interested in lectures. Positive grading really isn't as bad as most people here say, you might get docked a few points on a couple assignments because of it. Be prepared to work, the homeworks are extremely long and require a decent amount of bio and CS knowledge"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Smart guy and good at lectures, but assignments were often vaguely worded and usually required 25+ hours in order to finish. His grading system only gives you points for saying specific words, so you end up writing 500+ words per sub question to ensure that you don't lose any potential points. Audit the class if you can just for the lectures."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Best cs professor I've ever had, he makes complicated concepts easy to understand. But despite having no exams, this class is NOT EASY. Analysis portions of bi-weekly homeworks are super open-ended, and he expects you to hit points that aren't explicitly stated in the question. Even going to office hours doesn't guarantee you'll get everything."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Great course, and you learn a lot. Be wary though, it is very difficult to do well on the assignments because of his ""positive grading"" approach. If you do not hit on every point, even if it is not explicitly asked for in the question, you will lose points."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"hartemink is really smart, so his lectures and personality get really pedantic and condescending. the questions on the homework can be open-ended so they only give you points if you write exactly what they want. there's also a participation grade where you basically post on piazza and go to office hours and hope you get full participation credit"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"One of the best professors I had at Duke. Although he's a compsci professor, I took his Ethics class and he provided pretty interesting insight. He is well-organized and clear about what he expects from his students, but also open and caring to hear and learn new ideas. Highly suggest taking a class of his!"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Best professor I've had at Duke. AMAZING lecturer, funny, nice and super distinguished, but genuinely cares about teaching undergrads. Answers every Piazza question win 24 hours. No tests, all Psets. Go to lecture or you're screwed. If you go to class and office hours, Psets are completely doable. Loved this class, it was really rewarding."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"This is probably the best class I've taken at Duke. Intellectually engaging, interesting, fun. We got into some pretty difficult material but he makes it so clear that as long as you go to lectures and listen, you will be fine. This class helped me understand my other classes better- couldn't recommend enough!"
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"Possibly the smartest professor at Duke period (Triple Major in Econ CS and Math at Duke, Rhodes scholar, Oxford Masters in Econ and Masters and Ph.D in ECECS from MIT). He's truly excited by his work and takes a genuine interest in teaching, something that few professors at his level do.  He manages to elucidate very difficult concepts. "
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"So chill. Just do prob set and you will be fine. I heard it was hard for some people. If you are a CS major, it will be pretty straightforward (especially if you have taken algorithms or intro to programming). Perl is not too bad, be sure to use EPIC debugger. It will make your life easier."
Alexander J. Hartemink,4.6,"One of the best professors at Duke. Bioinformatics is a challenging and diverse class that requires a lot of time commitment, especially when biweekly psets are due. However, Alex makes it extremely cogent and clear (if you go to class). Programming isn't necessarily too difficult in this class; however, perl can be hard to pick up."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"A smart guy with a good personality. On average, students received 2 assigned readings, 2 quizzes, & 2 labs each week, & a project every other week. Two midterms and a final (for the most part they were fair). The TA's really run this course. Attendance is basically mandatory because although they post the lecture slides, they do so w/o the answers"
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,He explains things clearly and is happy to engage in teaching. Recommended because he knows his things very well.
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Really great lecturer, especially when considering the quality of most CS lecturers after 201. Knowledgeable and approachable. Don't know why other reviews say he is dry -- you want him to be a clown or something? He covers the materials well, explains & connects topics, and has great pacing -- always finishes the slides without it feeling rushed."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"One of the more boring lecturers I've had while at Duke. Some of his lectures felt irrelevant to the course content, and it just became a scramble to learn the content by yourself or from TA's. Loved the fact that he used discussion as a pseudo office hours. Other than that, wouldn't recommend anything else about this course. Just take 250 instead."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"This is definitely a hard class, but Professor Lebeck does a really good job at explaining the concepts well. The homework takes forever, but if you put in the time and go to office hours you'll do well. I learned a lot and found the class very interesting."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"This is for his special topics course (CS 590 Parallel Computing). He's a decent lecturer, using decent slides from other professors. But, he offers very little help on the homework, so you have to do a lot of work yourself to figure them out. The workload was above average. While I have learned a lot, the class was very mediocre/average overall."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"I've done the best I've ever done in his class; very clear with what he is looking for. You have to work hard, but he is understanding and will help if you put in work"
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"The material by nature is kind of dry, but he does a good job of explaining it clearly. The TAs are very helpful. But make sure you start the homework early!! Otherwise there will not be enough people to help you and you will be overly stressed for no reason. Overall, this class is definitely doable and Lebeck is a good professor."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Handled COVID-19 by far the best out of all my professors, he was able to get the class material across effectively while also being very accommodating to students"
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"This was a very hard class for me, especially the first half of the year. 3/6 projects were extremely difficult imo, tests weren't bad. Going to OH for projects is essential imo. Very good communicator, cares about his students, one of the better lecturers in the CS dept imo. Handled covid situation the best out of all my profs."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"CS250 at Duke is pretty standard - it's a lot of work no matter the prof. What differentiated Lebeck for me was how he handled Covid-19. He beefed up office hours, got rid of assessments, and made hidden tests visible to make our experience at home a bit easier. Easily one of the most caring profs I've ever had, and mad respect to him for this."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,This professor is a god.
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Lebeck was a very accommodating professor and a clear lecturer. He genuinely cares for his students and wants us to do well. He made the tests very doable and straightforward to make up for the fact that the pset are quite hefty. The class is a considerable amount of work; however, this is just how the course is taught at Duke."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Prof. Lebeck is a solid professor. While this class is definitely tough, he truly tries to help students get through it, and cares about his students. It's a large step up from CS201, which is why lots of students complain about it. However, I started off this class with the same perspective, but after changing my outlook it ended up alright!"
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,People complain about his class because its the first real CS class they take (201 doesn't count). It's honestly not that hard. Professor Lebeck is a solid professor. He knows his stuff in and out and is good at explaining concepts. I would take the class again with him no problem.
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Second rate class taught by a second rate professor part of a second rate CS department. Do not take this class, or the major, unless you want to become a computer scientist."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"Lebeck some flack on here because it is, to be fair, a difficult class with a lot of work. However, Lebeck is probably the best lecturer in the Compsci department I've had and wants people to do well. Homeworks are long and difficult, but he has clear grading criteria and the class is very organized. If you have to take 250, take it with him."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,Class is a lot of work but Lebeck is a very clear lecturer
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"250 is just a hard class, not Lebeck's fault. He's a fine lecturer and does his best to make the content not dry. He's a great guy and wants the best for his students, but also expects them to work for it. Enjoyed taking the class with him."
Alvin R. Lebeck,3.9,"CS250 is not a class you can just breeze by. While some parts of the homeworks this semester were harder than previous years, it was offset by easier exams. I wouldn't hate on Lebeck, as he's truly trying to teach the material. Lectures are a bit dry, but that's sort of expected. People shouldn't hate on the prof, the material is just hard."
Matthew Lentz,5,"Lentz is a great professor- he is always clear and transparent about his work and the class so you're never kept guessing about what will be tested or how you will be graded, which I appreciate. No surprises, and lecture is clear with some good examples. "
Matthew Lentz,5,"Pedagogically UNMATCHED. If you are a CS major, Lentz is a must-have. Don't let his relative newness to Duke deter you! He's incredibly knowledgeable and wonderful at communicating complicated material in an easily understandable way. Duke is lucky to have him - get this guy tenure immediately!"
Matthew Lentz,5,good teaching. Very accessible outside of class and extremely clear  when talking about the content.
Matthew Lentz,5," Dr Lentz was an absolutely incredible lecturer who made Operating Systems, famously one of the hardest classes in CS, easy to understand, interesting and accessible. If you want to deeply understand how systems works, with the underlying tradeoffs and mindsets involved, with a really good lecturer, go for his courses."
Matthew Lentz,5,"I loved Prof Lentz's class. He consistently goes the extra mile to help outside of class, and he treats you like an adult. Late policies were strict, but his teaching was fantastic. Every class we would dissect 1-2 of the most important research papers in Secure Systems Engineeringpublished anywhere from 1970 to 2021. Take his class if you can."
Ashwin Machanavajjhala,2,"Ashwin is knowledgeable but his lectures are not very engaging. At times he seemed a bit indifferent and unapproachable. This course was a mess logistically with unclear deadlines, slow grading/feedback, and Piazza questions left unanswered even as due dates passed. 216 is an easy class, just keep up with HW and project deadlines to get an A."
Ashwin Machanavajjhala,2,This class is bad and Ashwin is bad. Lectures were bad. Assignments were unclear. Policies were inconsistent. Final poster presentation was horribly inefficient and a colossal waste of time. I genuinely wish I didnt pursue a CS minor because of this class.
Ashwin Machanavajjhala,2,"He really knows his stuff, but he doesn't seem to care too much on the teaching. He could've done much better."
Ashwin Machanavajjhala,2,"Extremely disorganized. Terrible feedback and unclear grading criteria. That said, it is an easy class, just don't expect to learn much"
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Maggs is really funny and since he didn't write the slides, whenever he doesnt understand something he'll tell a funny story until he understands what's going on. Midterms are easy, projects take some time, and he had an optional final."
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Professor Maggs was a very enjoyable professor. His lectures were entertaining and he tried to incorporate more applicable, real-world information though occasionally he didn't know the slides super well as he didn't write them. Tests were very fair and off lectures/projects. The projects did take a solid amount of time, make sure to start early!"
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Maggs' graduate course on computer security was easier than almost all of my CS classes taken at Duke. Midterms were extremely easy, and we had 2 assignments that took maybe 10-20 hours each. The final was a group paper on basically anything we wanted related to computer security. He comes with good stories, and is generally lenient."
Bruce Maggs,4.3,Very interesting class and Prof Maggs is great at explaining the material while also keeping classes fun. Lenient grading. 
Bruce Maggs,4.3,Dude is a total chiller. Founder and current VP of Security at Akamai. Often wears Hawaiian shirts. 
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Mid1: two questions were hard, others amazingly easy.Mid2: every question was easy.Final: pretty hard, but manageable. That said, the things you learn are hard. I've heard his curve is pretty good, though he doesn't specify it. He's really laid back and funny, but he doesn't use notes when he teaches so sometimes he gets lost during the lectures."
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Bruce Maggs is amazing. Distributed Systems was the best class I've taken at Duke. For someone with so much experience in the space, he is really good at explaining it. He also chooses very interesting and relevant topics to teach. His stories about industry are also awesome."
Bruce Maggs,4.3,"Funny and keeps class entertaining. Homeworks are a bit challenging, but he is easily accessible at office hours. Tests and final were absurdly easy"
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Kamesh is a good lecturer and very passionate/knowledgeable, but he does go pretty fast and his exams are difficult. I spent a lot of time working on the homeworks (which were thankfully done in groups of up to 3) and reviewing for exams. You'll learn A LOT, but this is more of a pure math course than a CS course tbh. Lectures are recorded yay."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Honestly, didn't expect I would have been spending much time on this course, but turned out tests got tougher throughout the course. The course starts off very easy, but accelerates in difficulty. That said, the professor seems to really like what he teaches. This course is not CS, not a pure math course. If you don't like math, don't take."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Solid class. Learned a lot, and Kamesh was very good at presenting material."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"One of the best courses I've ever taken. Course materials are super cool and lectures are clear. Wonderful professor, this is Duke after all!"
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,Solid
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Kamesh either has no clue what he's doing, or he doesn't care about undergrad education at all. Either way, he is one of the many massive embarrassments that Duke's CS department so deeply suffers from."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"This is the worst professor I've had. There were two midterms and a final. In both midterms multiple students received around 10-15 +points when they submitted regrade requests. But, this was not allowed for the final. The professor is unaccessible, lacks communication skills, and doesn't care about his students at all. Not Duke calibre."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Clearly knows algorithms inside and out, but not good at communicating with his students or helping them understand. Expectations were often unclear. Not a professor you need to avoid at all costs (he teaches the classes you have to take for the CS major anyway, so it wouldn't matter if he were), but definitely not one to seek out either."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Everything I learned in this class, I taught myself by reading the textbook, reading tutorials online at GeeksforGeeks, or watching youtube videos explaining problem-solving techniques. Proofs for algorithms covered in lecture were often extremely weak and provided no insight. Any questions asked in lecture were often given convoluted answers."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"HORRIBLE PROFESSOR. Cannot teach. Gives NO advice on how to do well. Tests are not related to homework. Lectures are not helpful because professor makes vague implications and assumes ""it works"" without details on why it works. Grading is very sketch. Arbitrary points that are not consistent among students. Would NEVER take again. Very bad prof."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"He's smart and clear in lecture. His tests are hard but people still somehow manage to get 100's on them, so they can't be that bad (avg. is around 70). I will say that the tests are usually harder than anything you've seen in the homework and there's usually a curveball. Interesting class overall. "
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Very smart professor, knows a lot about algorithms and applications.  I found him to be good at explaining, but he expects a lot from the students. He goes in depth and proves everything, beyond what you need to know for tests.  The homeworks, rather than the lectures, prepare you for tests."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,Great professor and incredibly smart. Fair grader and patient and very clear explainer. Not very enthusiastic becuase he prolly does not feel that the students are enthusiastic (which is not his fault)
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Lectures can be dry and difficult to follow, but that's mostly due to the material, not the professor.  Sometimes I felt like the info from lectures and the textbook wasn't enough to solve all the exercises in the homework.  Grading is fair."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,He is very smart person but that does not mean he is a good teacher. He is too smart to teach people. His lecture is very boring and I found that people often have trouble to understand the course material from his lecture.
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,"Amazing teacher! Very smart. Presents hard material in a very clear and interesting way. You learn a lot, but the work-load is relatively light. One of the best teachers I've ever had."
Kamesh Munagala,3.2,a bit of a jerk and very full of himself

Kartik Nayak,2.8,"As a prof I genuinely liked Kartik. He was  passionate about the topics, knew a ton about the history of computer security which lead to many interesting tangents, and obviously cared for his students. A solid, well-meaning professor. However, the quizzes were insanely hard, labs were tedious and long, and grading criteria was often unclear"
Kartik Nayak,2.8,"Let me start with the good stuff. I think he cares about his students, he knows everyone by name and open to questions in class. I've definitely had way worse lecturers than him in the cs department. He is enthusiastic in lectures. However, the quiz questions are very vague. It's almost like he wants you to exactly know what's going on in his head."
Kartik Nayak,2.8,"Honestly avoid this class at all cost, useless office hours by the professor and TAs, and the labs are extremely hard that the lectures or any resources they give you will not help. Each lab requires googling for hours for anything remotely relevant. Worst class I've taken as a CS major by far."
Kartik Nayak,2.8,"Extremely disappointing class. The lecture topics are interesting but the professor's explanations are extremely unclear to the point that if questions are asked to clarify the content, the class will literally never end. Also gives out difficult quizzes that are beyond the content of the class (a consensus amongst all the students)."
Kartik Nayak,2.8,"This course is graded on very few assignments, and the grading criteria is extremely unclear. The final project is worth most of your grade, and the instructions for it are so minimal that its impossible to tell whats expected from you. The lectures were very interesting, but not worth the ambiguity."
Kartik Nayak,2.8,A really great lecturer and provides so many interesting real world examples of the topics taught in the course. The labs created in the course were also very cool and quite fun to complete also. At the end there is a final project and I learned lots of interesting things from other students.
Kartik Nayak,2.8,Very fun and interesting class. Assignments are mostly labs and as long as you attend lecture you'll be fine.
Kate OHanlon,2.4,"She gives long rambling lectures, and when asked questions, she gives extremely vague and sometimes incorrect answers. There are quizzes every day of class, often with confusing wording. The only that kept me from completely failing this class was the fact that the TAs know what they are talking about (any of them could teach better than the prof)"
Kate OHanlon,2.4,Class is hard to understand because the professor clearly hasn't mastered the material. Has difficulty answering questions in lecture and often provides vague or incorrect answers. Very annoying in-class quizzes every lecture and the questions/answers are extremely ambiguous. 
Kate OHanlon,2.4,"Most difficult class of my entire life. She never once answered any of my emails, even when other professors for this class told me to email her, and even when she emailed me first to ""offer resources"". Clear disregard for if students do well and most students assumed they would fail out due to the 40-50% averages on exams. Do not take this class."
Kate OHanlon,2.4,CS 230 is probably one of the easiest classes that I took during the summer. People complain that it's hard but it's probably because they don't listen during the lectures. Class is literally trivial but also very interesting.
Kate OHanlon,2.4,"Do not take a class with O'Hanlon if you can help it. She is a mediocre teacher at best. Disorganized, she makes big changes to grading and exams last minute, including taking points off for something. In my class of 50 last summer, over 50% signed a petition to the Dean to make the class S/U because of how disorganized and chaotic everything was."
Kate OHanlon,2.4,"The guidelines of this class were very clear right from the start. A lot of people complained, but honestly, I felt that they weren't really willing to work for it since we were at home. This is a CRUCIAL class for the CS major, and it's not something you should just be able to get by. It's work, but it's interesting, and Kate is really helpful."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,Excellent lecturer. He explains things coherently. Homework is hard but exams are much easier and curved. A recommended version of 330.
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Dr. Panigrahi is an incredibly talented lecturer who is able to explain advanced topics clearly. He engages the audience well and asks thought-provoking questions to reinforce material. Exams and homework are quite challenging, but the class is curved. Course is administratively run poorly, but that's not a reflection of his ability as a teacher."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Lectures were disorganized, notes were sparse and hand-written (very difficult to understand), homeworks are grueling, and office hour waits are 2+ hours. Prepare to learn most of the content on your own."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"A poor lecturer overall, and a poorly designed class. Very disorganized, professors took weeks to get exams back to us. Sometimes the homeworks had mistakes that affected our answers. Co-taught with Rong Ge, who was a better lecturer. Overall a very time consuming and difficult proof-based class"
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Not sure why Panigrahi's ratings are so much lower than Ge's - they co-taught the course and you don't know who decided on the harsh grading!!! Yes, 330 is difficult and didn't transition well online with long OH queues, but Panigrahi himself was a solid lecturer who taught very difficult concepts well. He is also kind and very open to extensions."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"I took the class Fall 2020, the first semester online. You need to make time for office hours (go earlier in the week, I recommend doing hw friday through sunday), and really think about the classwork on your own time, and work on comprehension instead of just fact digestion. I think if it clicks, its an easy class (I hated 250, but 330 was great)."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Decent guy but very unclear, hard to understand, and grades difficulty. Not very understanding. Take class with just Rong Ge or another professor who cares more and explains clearly."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Algorithms are one of the most important things you can learn in CS. Too bad the online version of class is uninspiring, difficult, and run by overworked TAs. Lectures are unorganized and overcomplicate simple concepts. In order to even understand the homework, you have to go to office hours. Professors are so out of touch it's embarrassing."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Listened to student feedback after grades were curved down originally. I thought he was a much better lecturer than Rong Ge, and he had a great grasp of the material. Homework takes a lot of time each week, and take home exams (during covid) took hours and hours each time. Definitely learned a lot though"
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Professor Panigrahi (co-teaching with Professor Ge) was an okay lecturer and explained the concepts to a certain extent. Some clarifications, whether it be through office hour TAs or synchronous lectures, were needed to clear up the confusions through some parts that were touched on but not elaborated on. Very understandable with long exam slots."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"I took both 230 and 330 with him, and as a senior I think he's probably the worst professor I've had at Duke. His explanations are useless (pro-tip: yt channel ""Stanford Algorithms"" is amazing for 330 instead) and confusing, hw and tests are much harder than other profs (like donald for 230), and he dgaf about students (curved down during covid)"
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,Avoid if you can. Curved CS 330 (a harder class) students grades DOWN during covid times to fit his preferred percentiles. Way to punish everyone who tried harder this semester.
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"230 is definitely not an easy class with Panigrahi, but he makes the learning worth it. Once you get past the slight accent, his lecturing is one of the best among CS profs at Duke. Step by step, logical, and comprehensive. Cares 100% about helping you understand the material. Homeworks are tough but TA's are super accessible and willing to help."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,his lectures were very boring an hard to follow. the homeworks and test were ridiculously hard. the only positive is he will recognize your effort if you try really hard.
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"This professor was substituting for Dr. Ge for CS 330. I really enjoyed the lecture he gave and he kept the students engaged by asking questions and explaining everything. No clue how he is overall as a teacher but based on the one lecture, I feel like his rating should be better."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Like a few of the other comments said, if you take 230 with him you'll have a much worse time than with any other prof. Most of the content we covered was never covered in any other 230 prof's class (or even my friends at Stanford/MIT's discrete math courses) because it went so much deeper into the material."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,CS230 in the past has been a bit of a joke class but Panigrahi (who usually teaches 330) decided it needed to be upgraded and made it a very difficult class that was quite confusing and not fun at all. His lectures were just him saying things and not explaining the concepts.
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"Professor Panigrahi did a good job of tackling 230, given that Duke is trying to make it a more rigorous class than the joke it was before. His lectures were clear and straightforward and he made sure people could always ask questions/clarifications. Weekly HWs that were graded a bit tough, but very fair midterm/finals."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"His lectures are alright, but his tests were ridiculously hard compared to other 230 professors. Our midterm averages were in the 50s and 60s, which is way lower than any other semester. The homeworks are difficult and he just makes the class absurdly hard for no reason. Do not take 230 with him."
Debmalya Panigrahi,3.3,"A truly amazing professor. He really care about his students and is always available if you reach out. You have to work for a good grade in his class, but you will definitely learn a lot."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Simple grading scheme: 30% Midterm, 30% Final, 40% HW. Lectures are super dry, mathematical, and boring, but the tests emulate the much easier optional discussion worksheets so go to those. Parr is a great guy who really does try and care, his lecture style is just dry."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Ron Parr is a really nice guy that cares about his students. However, I found that he spent a little too much time during lecture explaining the philosophical meaning behind algorithms at a high level rather than rigorously walking through examples to further our understanding of them. Overall, not the worst class I've taken, but not fantastic. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"I would rather get run over by a semi trailer than take this class again. The lectures are incredibly boring and I learned NOTHING from them. I would drink a redbull before each class but I still fell asleep and the slides are impossible to follow on your own. I have never regretted taking a class so much, DON'T TAKE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"The content itself isn't the hardest but the prof's lectures are ridiculously bland and difficult to follow. The slides themselves are impossible to parse by themselves, there's no recordings so if you miss something you're done. Ended up getting taught by TAs. Take this only if you're good at learning out of a textbook"
Ronald Parr,2.7,"The class topics are interesting, albeit math-heavy/theoretical, he's a fine teacher and explains concepts well, and the projects are rewarding though difficult. What I will say is that Parr is very dismissive of students. I've noticed that he can be very disrespectful on the Ed forum where we're encouraged to ask questions if we're confused. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"While Parr's lectures were often dry and can be boring to follow along to, he definitely showed a lot of care to his students and tried to make each class engaging. I also felt he managed to explain the course concepts well enough for me to get a good grasp."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"This class is horrible. For what should be an interesting topic, the lectures are unbelievably boring and the assignments are impossible to follow. It is all math/proof based and there is nothing practical about it. I 10000% regret taking this class."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"this class isn't practical at all, most of the content we are learning seems irrelevant and so boring. It is much more math heavy and proof based than I thought and I'm honestly so uninterested in this class I don't care what grade I receive at this point. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"The content is much more mathematical and proof-based than I expected, and it needs to be more practical. The lectures are very dry and unexciting despite the content being interesting. Professor Parr is a nice guy and pretty approachable but I don't think his teaching style is suitable for undergrads."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Professor Ron Parr is definitely the top 1 most patient professor I've had at Duke. For COMPSCI370, the assignments are comparatively easy if you've taken CS201, and Professor Ron Parr is very receptive to student opinions and explain everything in great detail in lectures."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Prof. Parr is a nice person but his lecture is confusing and dry. A LOT of typos in homeworK, and students needed clarifications throughout the midterm. Not accessible outside class, somewhat intimidating during office hours. Comparing to other STEM professors at Duke, I don't think he cares a lot about or understands undergraduate students. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"The content is extremely outdated, nothing relevant/applicable to work you will do in industry jobs. There is very little assistance from the professor/TA. They barely answer Ed posts, their homeworks/tests are riddled with typos. They copy their assignments + return homework weeks after submitted, even after next homeworks are released."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Least favorite professor at Duke. Lectures are confusing and slow. HWs are long just because they are confusing. Gradings are harsh. He is a nice person but not a good professor [too many typos in the HWs, slow responding to questions, not reachable after class]. "
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Dr. Parr was very accommodating and generally a nice person to have as a professor. However, his lectures were a bit dry, but that was at least partly due to the course being online."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Im torn on RP. Hes an adequate lecturer, not super clear or engaging. He seems to really care about students and is always willing to help, both inside and outside of class. But some administrative things were subpar. HW (and online exams) often had typos and were graded somewhat slow, though grading was generous. Overall, more pros than cons"
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Was a little scared from the other reviews on here but Parr is solid. HWs are long and sometimes wording can be unclear, so going to OH is almost mandatory. In general though, you learn a lot and Parr does a good job of keeping lectures engaging by putting on a different costume for each one. Textbook is really helpful. Time intensive class."
Ronald Parr,2.7,Prof. Parr is a beast. Intro to AI was super interesting and the lectures were really good - prolly one of my favorite classes and favorite profs
Ronald Parr,2.7,"Material incredibly cool. And take it with Prof. Parr if you want to learn a ton about AI. BUT if I hadn't dedicated a lot of time to it (including doing over half the readings), I would not have done well in this class. Very smart, willing to explain things. Lecture too fast for me sometimes. CS330 helps. Know what you're getting into."
Ronald Parr,2.7,"The other ratings had me so nervous to take this class but he is an amazing professor. He truly knows what he is talking about, he is always ready to give help and is great at understanding what the confusion is. The homeworks are hard but if you start as soon as they come out and go to OH you will be fine! He was also so understanding about covid"
Ronald Parr,2.7,"He's very knowledgeable about what he's teaching but demands a lot and assumes you will know a lot coming into the class. Homeworks are very involved and take forever, with both coding and written math portions. Grades harshly and very difficult material; don't take this class if you're taking a couple other demanding classes, it won't be fun"
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"CS342: Although she was a bit dull when I took CS201 with her, in this course she was great: lectures were interesting, she explained the concepts thoroughly, and the course was structured nicely with good hws, projects, and exams. This may be because CS342 is more aligned with her area of research."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,Class was flipped and used materials already available on her course on Coursera. Lectures were sometimes dry but the content of the class is easy. We got out after finishing the in-class assignment 10 minutes early every class. 
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"This is an easy class w/ not too much hw, however: her lectures are extremely boring and did nothing to enhance my comp sci knowledge. Prof Rodger made attendance mandatory by having forms to fill out every class about the lecture but you don't have to be there to do it. She wasn't helpful in answering questions. If u skip lecture, its not too bad."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,Professor isn't helpful or kind. Lectures are boring
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,Least helpful professor I have ever had. Learned nothing in lecture and relied heavily on the textbook that she didn't even write. The work itself isn't terrible but you have to rely on yourself to learn anything in her class.
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"I found CS101 to be a very fun and interesting class. However, I learned all of the material on my own, Prof Rodger's lectures did not add much. I had no coding background, and found the class extremely easy and the material intuitive. There is definitely a bunch of busy work though, with labs and APTs and APT quizzes and such. Tests are fair."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"This class was completely new material for me but it wasn't hard. I thought it was paced very well, the exams were not bad at all, and generally the projects could be completed within a day."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Class itself was very easy for me, no complaints with the professor, she taught the topics pretty well. Lectures are not mandatory, labs are pretty easy."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,I had some previous experience with Python so CompSci 101 was a fairly easy course for me. Prof. Rodger wasn't amazing but she was good enough. There are a decent amount of assignments. 
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Compsci94 with Professor Rodger is pretty easy. Use past exams to practice for tests and you'll be fine, especially since tests aren't weighed as heavily compared to other classes. Also, attendance is mandatory since your classwork gets checked off during class."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"If you have any coding background, CS101 with Professor Rodger is cake. If not, prepare to teach yourself the whole course. Lectures are boring and bland - I was more productive skipping them than going. Assignments are fair and courseload is average. Those with no CS background might struggle early on, but everyone figures it out by finals."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Prof. Rodger is approachable and her lectures are informative (although sometimes not very engaging). The course is well-structured but there is a lot of work (APTs, assignments, labs) and can be slightly overwhelming to those who have never coded before. Overall still a great course and exams (& grades in general) are very fair."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Pretty easy class, tests are easy provided you take the practice tests beforehand. Assignments seem like busy work, but most aspects of the class are good for building a foundation of programming. Lenient with dropping points in categories at the end of the semester and things of that sort."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,This course was one of my favorites that I've taken at Duke so far. I took it as a Focus class freshman fall which made it even better. This course is super accessible if you've never done anything with CS before. On the last day we voted on who had the best final project. The winners got prizes and she gave us all cookies!
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,Professor Rodger gets a bad rap from the reviews but I think a lot of the complaints have more to do with the general course structure than actually with Professor Rodger. Not the best professor I've ever had but her tests are more than fair and she gives out bonus points for filling out surveys etc.
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Never went to class but CS101 was easy and her tests were clear, as long as you do the practice tests"
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Workload was manageable and material was really easy. Assignments are scattered everywhere so you have to keep track of due dates and it's easy to forget to turn in something and instructions are written in a weird way that's hard to follow. Lectures were boring, I would say I learned 90% of the material from doing hw on my own and lab sections."
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"This class had a lot of work but the content itself was not super difficult. There are textbook readings and short quizzes before every lecture (you get 3 attempts), APTs, assignments, and labs. The first few assignments were fun, but the last three are very difficult and almost impossible to do without going to office hours. Exams were fair. "
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"Basically a self-study course. Stopped doing homework, lectures, etc. after the 2nd Exam. Exams! 4 of them! Ton of homework & projects. Projects are doable if you attend office hours. TAs are amazing. Professor is not involved. Doubt she even knows a single TA's name. Not terrible like everyone else says lol. But just doesnt care.
"
Susan H. Rodger,2.7,"GOATed for real. Grade is split across many things, like APTs, Assignments, Sakai Quizzes (with 3 attempts each) etc and exams are fairly straightforward and cover content from class. 

Took this class for funsies and now considering a CS major!"
Benjamin Rossman,2,"Professor Rossman is a nice and soft-spoken guy, although he is sometimes confusing and unengaging.  Grading is fair, and there were several extra-credit opportunities.  In general, the course is easy if you have a math background, although the final exam was a little challenging."
Benjamin Rossman,2,"Professor Rossman is knowledgeable, but only gets his points across about half of the time; he also uses confusing notation to explain things when a simple, clear-cut explanation would suffice. Homeworks are fairly short and easy, but exams (especially the final exam) don't reflect the homework material and are unnecessarily difficult."
Benjamin Rossman,2,"This course was the most chaotic I've taken at Duke, and I believe this is wholeheartedly due to the disorganization and general incompetence of Rossman and the graduate TAs. 230 has been required as part of the CS major for multiple semesters but felt like a brand new class that failed its students due to a lack of logistical and content clarity."
Benjamin Rossman,2,"Simply, an atrociously run class. Although the content is not that difficult relative to other CS classes, due to the sheer level of incompetence and lack of communication of the teaching staff (excluding a few TAs), it so much harder than is necessary. Rossman is an intelligent guy but lives in his own world and is an AWFUL instructor. "
Benjamin Rossman,2,Professor Rossman is proof that incompetence is alive and well here at Duke University. Were it not for the textbook I would be failing this course - lectures are riddled with errors and help via Ed or by anyone not an UTA is nonexistent. I don't think even the teaching staff knows what is going on logistically and communication is atrocious.
Benjamin Rossman,2,Professor Rossman is one of the worst lecturers I have ever had-- he writes things incorrectly on his lecture slides and is very unengaging. This class requires that you read the textbook on your own-- or else you won't understand any of the material. The exams were so hard for no reason and did not cover the material that we actually learned.
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Everyone who says its an easy A class is because of the extra credits. Although the exams are open note, midterm was very lengthy (didn't have time). Real midterm was much harder than sample (avg like 60%) The group project is quite worth alot, and if ur teammates don't do their job, extremely stressful. Not a terrible prof, but I won't take again."
Sudeepa Roy,3,worst cs class at duke. not a good lecturer at all and class is super disorganized. 0 recompense for any issues that go on in the group projects as well
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Extremely easy class to end with over 100% in. Midterm and final (only 35% combined) are the only grades you aren't guaranteed 100 on, but they are completely open note. Final average was very high and midterm was curved 15 points. Not the best lecturer but responds to student feedback well. Just do the extra credit and you will get an easy A/A+."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Thought it was going to be an easy A class, but it ended up being not so easy and only 40% of the class ended up getting an A. The curve for the class was 95+ for A. The final project takes a lot of time the entire semester and the homeworks, while good grades, took up time. The tests, though open note + book, kind of decide if you get an A or not."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"CS316 was a fun class that I enjoyed, however, there is a LOT of material to cover. Exams are fairly easy and straight forward, similar to practice exams Roy releases. Ignore these other negative reviews. Roy is a fair grader (gives LOTS of extra credit) and the group project for the course was super fun to work on."
Sudeepa Roy,3,Only good thing about this class is a seemingly easy A. Everything else is very disorganized. 
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Prof Roy is great and makes concepts easy to understand. Homeworks are not too bad, exams are curved generously, project is time consuming but not bad if you start early. Contains many useful concepts for industry, would rec for systems req."
Sudeepa Roy,3,THE worst cs class at duke.
Sudeepa Roy,3,"This is the type of class I rate as ""A+"", meaning Awful Plus. Many things, from exam to homework, is so disorganized. Worst CS class I took at Duke."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Boring lectures, unreasonable homework questions, overall disorganized. Midterm questions are unreasonably hard and and the answer key is flawed. Avoid as much as possible"
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Lectures are boring, hard to follow, and the class is very disorganized. This should be an easy class but the disorganization of lectures and class structure make it very hard to learn simple concepts."
Sudeepa Roy,3,This course is way too easy and therefore extremely boring. Can't even stay in class for 20 minutes. Also unorganized and exams sometimes disconnected from lectures. Basically a free A system course designed for lazy people who don't care to think.
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Pretty straightforward class. One of the easier CS classes- most people who take it get an A. Sudeepa is always great about seeing if anyone has questions and providing explanations during lecture if you ask her. As for the group project, make sure you have a good group, and definitely know what you're doing if you choose the open project option."
Sudeepa Roy,3,Class is a large group project with HW that you can collaborate with friends on. Class was doable. Lectures not very helpful refer to the slides. HW is a bit time consuming though but not too difficult. Professor is very understanding but Piazza is very dead. Discussion is super helpful.
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Mediocre in many ways. It's a free A system course so ig people love it anyway. Extremely boring, and I don't find the things she taught useful. Group projects were very frustrating, had to do almost half of the required work. If you have to take it with Prof Roy, make sure to not do the fixed project and get some reliable friends beforehand."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Great class, great professor! Prof Roy has truly tried to make this class a very manageable class during this online semester. She constantly asks for feedback from students on lectures/discussions, and will act upon them to improve the class. Homeworks and tests are all very doable. Lots of extra credit, so it's not difficult at all to get an A."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"She's an amazing professor. She makes sure that everyone understands the class material, and the exams are very doable. There were so many extra credit that so many people ended up with an A or A+"
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Lectures are boring and Sudeepa is just average. If you can get past her strong accent, you can watch lectures but just going through the slides and doing the work and you will be fine in the course. The positives: not too hard of a class, the grading is clear and there were many extensions across the semester."
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Dr. Roy is absolutely amazing! Probably my favorite CS professor at Duke. She is really caring, readily accessible outside of class, and very fair with work and expectations. Definitely glad I took a class with her. Other CS profs can learn a thing or two from Dr. Roy"
Sudeepa Roy,3,"Professor Roy was an amazing lecturer, I absolutely loved this class! I don't really get the bad reviews, she was super receptive to feedback and you can tell she really cares about our learning experience. Whatever was in the tests and homework was always covered in lectures, so there was no need to read up by ourselves, unlike other CS classes."
Cynthia D. Rudin,4.8,Awesome class and I definitely learned a lot. Homework takes a considerable amount of time and is very difficult.
Cynthia D. Rudin,4.8,"She really understands the material insight out, and gives great, rigorous lectures. The homeworks take a considerable amount of time."
Cynthia D. Rudin,4.8,Shes a really good teacher. Homeworks were though but helpfull in learning the applications. She makse you work for it but it easy to get a good grade.
Cynthia D. Rudin,4.8,"Great class, but lots of work. Homework takes a considerable amount of time. Her notes are great, in my opinion, but her lectures can be a bit dry sometimes. Overall, learned a huge amount, but this is a super fast paced class."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"As a CS major, course is conceptually easy, but KSM creates a lot of busywork (comprehension quizzes & participation). KSM apparently specializes in CS education but I think she overdoes it and treats students like middle schoolers who need hand-holding. Still uses Fain's recorded lectures but attendance to her sessions + recitation also required. "
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"Prof. KSM was understanding of individual circumstances and let us turn in homework late w/o penalty via slip days. Her lectures did seem a bit like review of videos that we watched for the prepares, but they were still good. The exams weren't difficult if you did the practice exams and homework, but the ESNU grading can be frustrating."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"My background is about 5 CS classes and found this class as a breezy and properly-paced introduction to Python. KSM is very caring and accommodating outside of class. My final grade was rounded up, ty. Every test has a retake which made things way less stressful. Spent around ~3 hrs weekly. If u finish assignments u will def get an A"
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,The grading criteria is vague for exams but other than that this course was amazing
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"I loved CS216, and learned so much from it despite having no Python coding experience in the past. Strongly recommend taking it!"
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"Professor KSM teaches using a reversed classroom system since she believes that students learn more effectively this way. This results in students learning from a separate professor that has no involvement in the course through video lectures, while Professor KSM wastes 3 hours of your week doing random surveys through class and teaching nothing."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"The videos from Fain are good. The actual teaching is hideous.
Also the grading system is hideous. What an embarrassment."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"In class, you can learn almost nothing. The professor is just asking meaningless concept questions and reading the PPT. From this course, what I only learn is that it is really easy to become a professor, Prof.Kristin just reads PPT and uses OTHER PROFESSORS' VIDEO AND PPT to teach!"
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"KSM is a ""CS education"" researcher, so she gets very defensive when people complain about her incredible research-backed teaching style of making you learn all the material outside of class from video lectures by a DIFFERENT prof, and spending all of every actual class period giving pointless quizzes, each of which gets taken twice for some reason"
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"Everything useful I have learned has been from Brandon Fain or the TAs...because it's flipped and we use Fain's videos (which are helpful). The in-class peer instructions are not helpful, and her explanations are vague. Extremely inefficient lectures. Unless you want to be a guinea pig in KSM's CS ed research experiment, don't take this class. "
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"KSM is a perfect example of academia failing in the real world. Class is focused around education research, but in practice, this turns out awful. Flipped class w/ videos from other professor. In-class portion is waste of time w/ 4-5 mini ungraded quizzes and time for practice. Everyone goes on Zoom and few pay attention. Feels like coursera..."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"To be honest, this is the most useless and boring course I have ever taken. The nature of the course is the coursera course. Moreover, the exam is hard and the grading is really tough. Some minor mistakes would drag you to A- level. You can only pray when doing exam while learning nothing in the class."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"KSM is not a good professor. She knows very little about the material and relies on other professors' work to teach her class. Yet when you use outside sources to aid your learning, she doesn't allow it and marks points off because it doesn't ""demonstrate your own understanding""."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"CS216 is a very easy class. However, KSM does not want her students to do well. Instead of making her class more complicated and advanced. She just tries to screw students over in other small ways by making trick questions or excessively deducting points for formatting and other things."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,NOT DROPPING THIS COURSE IN DROP/ADD PERIOD IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I HAVE MADE AT DUKE.
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,All materials are from another professor in their group. Only exercises in lectures. Ridiculous mode of exams. Lack of trust in students while her mode of exams would simply lead to misunderstanding.
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,Prof. KSM is very caring and understanding of individual circumstances if you approach her outside of class. The course itself is flipped classroom and most likely more than 10 hours of work per week on average due to pre-class videos & quizzes and homework assignments. There is a semester-long group project that is very open ended and not too bad.
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"Pretty sure she writes reviews on here to pad her own rating. Often rude and unsure about her own assignments, heavily relies on the TAs to help students out. Does little teaching of her own and if you can't learn via youtube videos you won't gain anything from this class."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"Does flipped classroom but has required in-class activities so you'll end up spending twice as much time as you'd spend on a regular lecture on class alone. Homework is often unclear, and there's a lot of it in addition to a final project and four exams. Only saving grace is it's open note, but that doesn't make up for the brutal course schedule."
Kristin V Stephens-Martinez,2.4,"""Oh I heard KSM is teaching CS216 this sem. Does she teach well?""
""Umm she doesn't really teach, so I don't know what to tell you."""
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"She clearly cares a lot for her students, and devotes a lot of time to teaching and giving feedback to students on both homework assignments and students' research. However, she is a bit difficult to understand at times, and disorganized as well. She often assumes we know a lot more than we actually do know, so there are parts that make 0 sense."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"I've never in my life had a professor that I respected for their teaching, until Prof Sun. Professors so often teach knowledge, but Prof Sun teaches learning, discovery, and independence. She doesn't care what the answer is, but rather what you are thinking. She is always willing to help outside of class. She is honest and the best prof I know."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Xiaobai is one of the most caring and involved professors at Duke. If you get a chance, take one of her smaller lectures where you will have the chance to work with her directly on your projects. She was a profound help to my thesis in CS590."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Awesome professor! For graduate students, each class she teaches she wants you to bring back some new discoveries and techniques to your groups. She also pushes for you to apply class concepts to projects directly relevant to your thesis."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Fantastic instructor with full passions in her subject. Always willing to give help to any single student. If you are interested in REAL CS study, her course should be the best choice!"
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Encourages group work, particularly for tough projects. Gives great feedback and will always provide help, if asked for."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Absolutely inspiring professor. She is a huge fan of tough love, and will often have many criticisms of your projects, but if you follow her advice you will turn out your best possible work. Her parallel programming course taught me skills that enabled me to add significant speedup to many of my projects, and will be skills I use for a long time."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Although at times her class can be unstructured and she can be unclear, she is incredibly passionate about her subject matter and she supports every single one of her students. All work is take home and collaborative (including midterm and final), and there are no hard due dates, so you can work at your own pace. No textbook for class."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"Likely a great researcher, but not a great teacher.  Between her and her TA, we received our mid-term and two homework assignments less than 24 hours before we took our final exam.  Aside, it's a graduate course and yet we didn't cover higher order DEQ solvers.  The professor said it best when she described the semester as ""frustrating""."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,She cares a lot and is very nice. But she's been here for 20 years and is still speaks fairly incomprehensible English. The course is graded easily. Difficult material. Be prepared for her to tell a lot of stories. And UTAs are going to grade her grad class next semester.
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"EXTREMELY knowledgeable prof with fun who seems to honestly care about the students in her class. The class material is VERY difficult, but she is eager to make herself available for extra help."
Xiaobai Sun,4.1,"She's extremely kind, and she's always willing to help.  Unfortunately, she's not always very clear in  conveying her knowledge and often assumes you know a lot more than you actually do.  Hws will be very rough to get through, but they're graded extremely generously.  She's also extremely competent"
Carlo Tomasi,5,"The class is very organized and the notes/slides are well-written. Dr. Tomasi gives very clear instructions in homework/exams. He is a highly respected figure in the field of computer vision, yet he is very approachable and super nice to his students. "
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Amazing professor both inside and outside of the classroom. Very knowledgeable, and is a great lecturer. Homeworks and exams can be a bit tough, but nevertheless I had an awesome overall experience."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Fantastic professor, flexible grading, very clear notes. I looked forward to doing the homework. Final was unexpectedly hard compared to all questions completed throughout the course. "
Carlo Tomasi,5,Excellent professor. Really clear explanations on every topic. Easy grader.
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Outstanding lecturer who can explain just about any topic. Class notes are articulately written and replace the need for a textbook. While the class is mainly theoretical, homework assignments are really well crafted and give the opportunity for some practical implementations. Exams were harder than past semesters, but they were fair. "
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Most organized professor I've had. Lectures are clear and videos and notes online will be enough to understand the material. The exams are easier than the homeworks, which can take a good amount of time, so make sure to start early."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"I've taken both 371 and 527 with Tomasi, and I loved both. He is a great lecturer, and is great at explaining difficult topics. The class is a clearcut structure in terms of grading, and his exams are very reasonable. I would highly recommend any CS student take a class with Tomasi."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"100% recommend taking one of his classes. Incredibly understanding, has great notes and accessible exams"
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Tomasi really understands what he is talking about, and has incredibly clear and well-constructed lectures and class notes. The homework adds a coding component to the class that corresponds well with the material. The class notes are incredible tools for understanding ML concepts and if you read through them, you will have no trouble on tests."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"I was worried about taking this class as a 2nd yr, but Tomasi's ability to make complex concepts feel like common sense made this class my favorite over my time at Duke so far. The homework is done in groups of your choosing, the lectures were recorded, and the tests are straight-forward. He is a gem at Duke and I strongly recommend taking 371."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"This class is one of the best I've taken. The perfect level of difficulty, lectures/notes are clear & concise and still full of info, exams & homework are VERY well-made and I genuinely looked forward to doing assignments. Tomasi is very knowledgable and makes the material very approachable. Put in a reasonable amount of effort and you'll be good."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"The lectures were great, and the exams are easy if you read his notes, although they are quite dense. Homework takes a lot of time, so make sure to go to office hours if your code isn't working or need help starting on the question. Overall, great class."
Carlo Tomasi,5,Professor Tomasi is one of the nicest professors I've had at Duke. He is a leader in machine learning and puts knowledge and learning for the students above all else. I have never had a CS prof as dedicated to the subject as he is. He would write up good responses to student questions and dedicates time to teaching. Note: the class is hard though.
Carlo Tomasi,5,"You can tell that Tomasi knows what he's doing. Super smart, good at lecturing and explaining concepts, and really puts in the effort to help you learn (especially in adapting to the online format). Weekly homework can get difficult, but TAs are really helpful."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Tomasi is one of my favorite professors I've had. He definitely cares about his students, and his lectures (though somewhat theoretical) were clear and made the math behind ML very accessible. He's helpful in office hours, and also just gives great advice in general. Weekly HWs were reasonable and exams were extremely fair. I highly recommend him!"
Carlo Tomasi,5,"He's one of the best professors I've had and knows the subject so well (famous for it). It's a difficult and very rigorous class, and be prepared to read his notes (multiple times, sometimes), but you will become so much better at understanding (applied) math and really know the material. I honestly really enjoyed the class. Really organized, too."
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Prof. Tomasi is very organized, smart and pretty sassy at times. The grading is transparent and fair, and he is always available to answer student questions. His homeworks are thought-provoking, and you probably will come out with a more organized and precise approach to mathematics and CS after taking his class. Totally recommend him for CS 230."
Carlo Tomasi,5,The most organized professor at Duke by far. Tomasi is incredibly intelligent and yet is able to empathize with students in his lectures. The homework is tough but interesting. He has a nice grading policy and the exams are really doable if you know the concepts well. He's always there to answer questions on Piazza and has a nice sense of humor.
Carlo Tomasi,5,Hands down. He is the man. The most organized class I've ever had in my life.
Carlo Tomasi,5,"Very famous professor, very difficult subject. He teaches it well (as it's his bread and butter), but his voice can get a little boring at times. His notes are incredibly dense and require multiple look-overs to fully comprehend, but if you can do that, you don't ever need to go to class"
Yesenia Velasco,5,"Professor Velasco was amazing! She is so good at explaining tricky concepts, and she is incredibly kind and empathetic to her students. I had a difficult personal circumstance during the semester, but Professor Velasco was very accommodating and made sure I got back on track. One of the best profs in the department for sure. "
Yesenia Velasco,5,"Super kind and inclusive. Yesenia definitely understands that we are all beginners. Made me interested in pursuing computer science! With that said, this class is A LOT of work, there is something due like every day."
Lisa Wills,1.5,"One of the worst professors I've had at Duke: disorganized, condescending, and not clear at all in her explanations. Her assignments are awful and overall just not a good class."
Lisa Wills,1.5,"She's brilliant with her research but not that great of a professor. She can be a bit condescending at times towards students too. She shows potential to grow as an educator in the future, but for now she was not the best professor."
Lisa Wills,1.5,She is trying but inexperienced. Sometimes fails to control the pace and sometimes confused the entire class. Maybe it will get better in the future.
Lisa Wills,1.5,Best thing she did all year was read the slides someone else made for her. She does not know the content and makes fun of others for the same thing. Avoid.
Lisa Wills,1.5,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR!! There were three teachers teaching 210 this semester, but Wills nearly destroyed the class by herself. She takes the slides made by another professor (who's amazing btw!) and changes them so that you don't learn anything. Every chance she has to make you feel stupid and worthless, she takes it with pleasure. AVOID!!!!!!"
Lisa Wills,1.5,"This was definitley the worst class I'd taken at Duke, but it's not like she was malicious on purpose. It was her first time teaching, and she adjusted the workload after some complaints. I still struggled a ton, but I don't know a single person that got below a B-. Lisa isn't evil, it was just bad circumstances/unaligned expectations."
Lisa Wills,1.5,"She is not very respectful to students but this was one of her first times teaching. It was difficult to speak up in class due to her attitude but she would always answer questions from the people who did speak up. While she may not have been an amazing professor, some people learned a lot from her class (although the UTA was amazing at the time)"
Lisa Wills,1.5,An insane amount of work. Not very accommodating to students. Couldnt recommend less.
Lisa Wills,1.5,"She made 250 an even harder class by adding so much extra work. After several complaints to Deans, she restructured the class, but things were still very hard. For instance, tests were typically graded all or nothing -- meaning either you get full points for a problem or you get 0 points for the problem. She also is rude and not very understanding."
Lisa Wills,1.5,"Her updates to the course content were good, everything else wasn't. It's tolerable if she's strict with timing and assigns lot of work (started with excessive amounts). But she doesn't hold herself to the same standard, with typo-ridden exams and faulty testing code. Wasted class time on quizzes; right/wrong grading. Unreasonable and zero empathy."
Lisa Wills,1.5,AVOID AT ALL COST. She had very strict rules for students but her gradescope tests had uncountable many bugs and midterms with infinite typos. Very condescending and resisted most feedbacks. Gave pop quizzes every week instead of taking the time to explain concepts. Made a class that should be interesting extremely boring.
Lisa Wills,1.5,"Never take a course with this professor. Her grading criteria is unclear. She is rude to students for trying to take initiative which is extremely discouraging. Her tone is always condescending. I have never felt so disrespected by a professor in my life, which is surprising as it was clear she had no teaching experience."
Lisa Wills,1.5,I honestly dont think she wants to be a professor. Pretty much every lecture she had a negative attitude and gaslight students. Completely lacks empathy or remorse. Sucks cause the content is actually pretty interesting.
Lisa Wills,1.5,She doesn't deserve to teach a class ever again. She's the most heartless and unorganized professor I've ever had. Straight up copied Berkley's exact CS course and couldn't answer questions on her own slides. Put a student publicly on blast and has no professionalism. The TA's were more competent than her. Avoid at all costs.
Lisa Wills,1.5,"Professor Wills isn't a bad teacher, and you learn a lot in her class. The main issue (after initial course-correction) was that when most of us were struggling, she'd say things start earlier/we went over this/etc., so the students in turn got confrontational (some of this is on her/some empathy would be nice). The course itself is actually great."
Lisa Wills,1.5,By far the worst class I have ever taken at Duke - not because the material was too difficult but because Professor Wills have absolutely ZERO empathy for students. Any kind of request for additional accommodations are met with animosity and humiliation. I tried getting the deans involved in making the class better but even they gave up eventually
Lisa Wills,1.5,I think Prof. Wills has a massive disconnect between her expectations of students and how much time students have and how well she thinks she's teaching the material. Worst of all is she always blames students and rarely reflects on what she can do to help us. She's really insensitive and out of touch.
Lisa Wills,1.5,Treats her students like Facebook employees and grinds them into the dirt with assignments and content. Completely unable to answer questions related to project content and diverts questions to TAs whenever possible. Verbally berated a student on piazza for the whole class to see. Clearly extremely intelligent but easily the worst prof at Duke.
Lisa Wills,1.5,"Inarguably the worst class I took at Duke. Not about grade since I'm not worried about mine too much, but the professor is really rude in class and blames most of the problem in this class on students with little self-reflection. She demands a lot from students in terms of attendance and homework, but makes typos on exams"
Lisa Wills,1.5,"Yes, this class had a heavy workload but that was not my problem. My issue with Professor Wills is her unbelievably rude attitude and her lack of empathy. She is very condescending and blamed students for an F average on the midterm. But when most of the class is failing, she should realize that it is a reflection of her as a professor."
Jun Yang,4.6,"Jun Yang is one of my favorite professors I've at Duke. He is a wonderful lecturer, and explains things at a great pace to allow for learning. I also greatly appreciated how much he cared for his students, which was seen from his office hours to making accommodations for the class given the hardships of the pandemic. Truly a professor I'd recommend"
Jun Yang,4.6,"Prof Yang really had a way of making dense concepts digestible, and he encourages students to find him after class/in office hours to clarify any questions. While the final project + final exam did get hefty at the end of the semester, he assigns the project early on and provides a lot of support with project design. Highly recommend his class!"
Jun Yang,4.6,"Jun is a great lecturer and makes great slides. The homeworks are lengthy but actually a lot of fun, as is the group project. Overall, grading is reasonable. Jun makes 316 a really enjoyable CS elective"
Jun Yang,4.6,Probably one of the best lecturers I've had at Duke; he breaks complicated things down really well in an easy-to-understand way. Also definitely one of the most caring professor's ive had as he was willing to change the course structure when students expressed that they were overwhelmed.
Jun Yang,4.6,"Yang is respectable and kind, but this class needs restructuring. Having a final exam + a project due in the same week is unbearable. Especially because the project is 90% learning web development on your own and 10% database. There is a huge learning curve, and on top of that, you cannot get above a 90% without EXTRA features. Absolutely terrible."
Jun Yang,4.6,"Prof Yang is a really great professor and is willing to meet with students during office hours to help in any way he can! The tests in the class are pretty average, but it's pretty easy to get 100s on the homeworks if you attend office hours and put in the time. The course project is also really rewarding and fun to complete! Overall good CS class!"
Jun Yang,4.6,Awesome prof who really cares about his students. If youre gonna take 316 make sure to take it with him!
Jun Yang,4.6,"I highly recommend Prof. Yang and his database course. He obviously cares about his students, gives very clear lectures, and can explain concepts in multiple ways. HW is pretty light so you can work on your semester-long group project (some kind of data-driven app). Exams are curved to a B if the class average is lower than that. Definitely take!"
Jun Yang,4.6,Best teacher in CS department. Would definitely recommend taking this course for one of your electives
Jun Yang,4.6,"Jun has mastered the art of the lecture. Read the slides on your own, it's incredibly dry. When you go to lectures, you magically understand everything. He really knows his stuff, and can actually teach what he knows (a vastly underrated ability among professors). Take one of Jun's courses at least once while you're at Duke. 10/10"
Jun Yang,4.6,"Good lecturer and nice guy. Light workload for a CS class, although the course material was a little dry at times."
Jun Yang,4.6,Very clear lecturer. Fully understands the content and presents it in an interesting and fulfilling way. Homework is also useful in conveying the content to the student. Semester group project is entirely reasonable and tests are based on lectures heavily (though slides are available on course site). Take the class! Learned a lot!
Jun Yang,4.6,"HE""S SO NICE!!!! Gives a ton of extra credit. Great at explaining concepts and always there for students. Really excited about the material and knows it well. Absolutely loves the course project and his passion shows. Also makes a  lot of Simpson references!  Puts a lot of effort into the course. "
Jun Yang,4.6,"Clearly among the best profs in the CS department. Very fair, great at explaining concepts, puts work into the class and truly cares about the students (all of which is rare in CS). You'll leave the class with a working understanding of databases and a useful skill set. I'd suggest that all CS majors take this class with him."
Jun Yang,4.6,"Amazing professor, really knows his subject well and is very good at passing his knowledge along. "
Jun Yang,4.6,Jun Yang is the best professor that I have had at Duke. His lectures are informative and easy to digest. He is wiing to work with you outside of class and has a real interest in talking through concepts with you. 1010. 
Jun Yang,4.6,I took Intro to Database Systems with Jun my senior year -- I wish that I had taken it sooner because I would happily take any class he offers. He's such a kind professor and explains things extremely well. He gives you all of the tools in order to do well in his class (which isn't always the case with the CS department). TAKE HIS CLASS!!!!!
Jun Yang,4.6,"Professor Jun Yang is an incredibly bright professor, and his course is very useful. I would highly recommend taking his database course, as it is not too difficult, the material is very interesting, and he is a good professor. Make sure you do the assignment ahead of time and do the practice midterms."
Jun Yang,4.6,"Professor Yang is the man! I loved his class on database. He's actually one of the cool professors at Duke who really cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Tests and homeworks are really reasonable (He helps you along the way too). Very understanding and a lot of office hrs for students. Oh, and he gives out tons of extra credits."
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,"No tests during virtual semester, so graded by only homeworks and small quizzes. Prof. Yang is very caring and often adjusted the course based on student feedback, like giving out more advice for difficult projects. Her lectures are not always the most clear but she answers student questions and clarifies. Textbook is very helpful. "
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,Virtual semester so no tests. Dr. Yang is a fine lecturer but not always clear and the lectures do get a bit dry at times. There were 5 labs of which the first 3 were fine but the last 2 were exceptionally difficult. Office hours are a must.
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,Class was absolutely brutal. Professor is very caring but is not the most clear with lectures. We didnt have exams this virtual semester and instead had five labs. The last couple got very difficult if you didnt understand the material well. Office Hours are a must.
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,The virtual nature of this semester's class caused a lot of logistical challenges. Dr. Yang really tried her best to respond to students' feedback and make changes on time. Not the most clear lecturer but fairly good. Textbook & internet are very helpful. Projects are good but can be difficult.
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,Overall a good class. The workload was on the heavy side.
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,The programming assignments are fairly difficult but doable. This class covers a ton of information. The semester was fine but the final was quite surprising/difficult as it covered topics barely covered in lecture and not even touched on the written homework. She also doesn't curve. Wouldn't take if you only care about grades
Xiaowei Yang,3.4,"Good class, enjoy"
